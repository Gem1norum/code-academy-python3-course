# Practising using 2D lists to retrieve test scores for specific students
#Your code below:
class_name_test = [["Jenny", 90], ["Alexus", 85.5], ["Sam", 83], ["Ellie", 101.5]]

print(class_name_test)

# here we extract Sam's test score
sams_score = class_name_test[2][1]


print(sams_score)

# here we extract ellie's test score using negative indices to reference both the list within class_name_test and the test score
ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
print(ellies_score)
